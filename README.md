# pinocchio
Filmseele: Pinocchio â€” a style-first, placeholder-only skeleton that turns the 1940 classic into a clean, accessible web exhibit + podcast scaffold. Includes semantic HTML, a tiny design system (indigo/gold tokens), act/character/theme stubs, and strict placeholder policy for future content.
