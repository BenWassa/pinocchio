# Sprints To Do

## Sprint 1: UX Audit & Accessibility Foundations
**Definition of Done:**
- All pages have skip links, semantic landmarks, and visible focus rings.
- WCAG AA contrast and keyboard navigation validated.
- Accessibility issues documented and resolved.
**Best Practices for AI Agents:**
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles only when necessary.
- Validate changes with automated accessibility tools and manual keyboard testing.
- Document all accessibility improvements.
**Agent Tasks:**
- Analyze all HTML files for semantic structure and missing accessibility features.
- Add a skip link at the top of each page for keyboard navigation.
- Ensure all main sections use semantic landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`).
- Implement visible focus rings for all interactive elements using CSS.
- Check and enforce WCAG AA contrast ratios for all color tokens.
- Validate keyboard navigation for all interactive components.

## Sprint 2: Responsive Layout & Grid System
**Definition of Done:**
- Layout is fully responsive across target breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1440px).
- No horizontal scroll; hero box ratio stable.
- Spacing and rhythm standardized using tokens.
- Responsive rules documented.
**Best Practices for AI Agents:**
- Use CSS grid/flexbox for layout.
- Test on multiple devices and browsers.
- Avoid hardcoded values; use tokens for spacing.
**Agent Tasks:**
- Refactor site layout to use a responsive CSS grid or flexbox system.
- Standardize spacing and rhythm for cards, chips, and buttons using design tokens.
- Test layouts at 320px, 768px, and 1440px widths; adjust breakpoints as needed.
- Remove any horizontal scroll issues and ensure hero box maintains aspect ratio.
- Document responsive rules in `development/docs/README.md`.

## Sprint 3: Design Tokens & Theming Engine
**Definition of Done:**
- All colors, spacing, radius, and shadow values are tokenized in CSS.
- Theme swap logic works for all modes and maintains AA contrast.
- No hardcoded colors or spacing remain.
- Token usage and theming rules documented.
**Best Practices for AI Agents:**
- Use CSS custom properties for tokens.
- Validate contrast and spacing for each theme.
- Document token structure and usage.
**Agent Tasks:**
- Centralize all color, spacing, radius, and shadow tokens in `site.css`.
- Refactor CSS to use only tokens for colors and spacing (no hardcoded values).
- Implement theme swap logic for Sepia and Celestial modes using CSS custom properties.
- Validate AA contrast and spacing for each theme.
- Document token usage and theming rules in `development/docs/README.md`.

## Sprint 4: UI Components Polish
**Definition of Done:**
- All UI components have consistent styles, states, and alignment.
- Visual hierarchy and readability are clear.
- Component standards documented.
**Best Practices for AI Agents:**
- Use design tokens for all component styles.
- Ensure interactive states are visually distinct.
- Document component patterns and rationale.
**Agent Tasks:**
- Audit all UI components (cards, chips, buttons, nav) for consistency and polish.
- Add hover, active, and focus states for all interactive elements in CSS.
- Ensure clear visual hierarchy and generous line-height for readability.
- Refine alignment and spacing for all components using tokens.
- Document component standards in `development/docs/README.md`.

## Sprint 5: Progressive JS Enhancement
**Definition of Done:**
- Advanced JS features implemented and documented.
- JS is non-blocking and enhances user experience.
- Performance and engagement tested with/without JS.
- Fallbacks and accessibility documented.
**Best Practices for AI Agents:**
- Write modular, accessible, and performant JS.
- Ensure progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.
- Document all JS features and fallback logic.
**Agent Tasks:**
- Develop advanced JS modules for navigation, micro-interactions, accessibility, and dynamic theming.
- Implement features such as animated transitions, interactive components, and enhanced accessibility tools.
- Ensure JS remains non-blocking and progressively enhances the user experience.
- Test performance impact and user engagement with/without JS enabled.
- Document all JS features, usage, and fallback behavior in `development/docs/README.md`.
